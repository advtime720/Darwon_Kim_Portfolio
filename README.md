## \<Ultrasonic Parking Sensor>
This was my first project at UIUC during freshman year. My partner and I created a parking sensor that lights up two LEDs based on the distance from an obstruction. We decided to use the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

## \<Bit-Serial Logic Processor>

For this project, my partner and I designed and implemented a bit-serial logic processor purely through hardware. 
This procesor can perform eight different, 4-bit bitwise operations. At a higher level, the processor consists of four main components:
- Register Unit
- Computation Unit
- Routing Unit
- Control Unit 

The Register Unit contains two 4-bit registers: register A and register B. The Routing Unit is used to choose which register will hold the final result.

## \<Python Webscraping Project>
https://github.com/advtime720/Python_Webscraping_-Codable-

I worked on this project while I was in the Project Team of the Codable RSO at UIUC. 
Our team developed a web scraping program that notifies the user when a new car deal with user-specified parameters appear. The user can choose the car make, model, price range, and more. 
This project was developed using the BeautifulSoup library to parse website html data in real-time. I specifically worked on cars_scrape.py and file_saver.py.
